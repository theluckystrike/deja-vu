// (#2993), which is how dsh-deja reached 0.20.8 against a 0.20.1 release. The
// release writes that number into a temporary copy, so the repository's own
// package.json never learned it — every one of the four was behind, and
// `extensions/opencode/package.json` said 0.1.2 for a package npm serves as
// 0.20.1 (#3627).
//
// The previous rule compared npm against the newest release tag and called a
// package ahead of it stranded, which was right while a release skipped such a
// package — the state dsh-deja sat in from 25 August 2026 at 0.20.4 against a
// 0.19.2 line, when two fixes for it would never have shipped. It has not been
// right since #2993, and it could only ever fire where the tags are: a shallow
// CI checkout has none, so the job that was supposed to catch this said
// nothing.
//
// Nothing here publishes.
